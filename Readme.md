# Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains solutions to problems from LeetCode and Codeforces using **TypeScript**.

## Structure

- `src/leetcode/` → Solutions categorized by difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`).
- `src/codeforces/` → Solutions categorized by **problem difficulty (rating)**.

## How to Use

Each problem will have:

- `index.ts` → The solution written in TypeScript.
- `README.md` → Problem description and approach.

We will use **TypeScript** for all solutions, ensuring **type safety and clean code**.

### Running the Code

To run the TypeScript solutions locally, we use **ts-node**. If you don't have it installed, you can install it globally via npm:

example
npx ts-node <file-path>/index.ts
